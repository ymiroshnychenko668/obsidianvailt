## 1. Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting (RSIP)

One of the most powerful techniques I've been experimenting with is what I call **Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting** (RSIP). This approach leverages the model's ability to critique and improve its own outputs iteratively.

### How it works

I need you to help me create [specific content]. Follow this process:

1. Generate an initial version of [content]
2. Critically evaluate your own output, identifying at least 3 specific weaknesses
3. Create an improved version addressing those weaknesses
4. Repeat steps 2-3 two more times, with each iteration focusing on different aspects for improvement
5. Present your final, most refined version

For your evaluation, consider these dimensions: [list specific quality criteria relevant to your task]




I've found this particularly effective for creative writing, technical documentation, and argument development. The key is specifying different evaluation criteria for each iteration to prevent the model from fixating on the same improvements repeatedly.

## 2. Context-Aware Decomposition (CAD)

LLMs often struggle with complex multi-part tasks that require careful reasoning. **Context-Aware Decomposition** is a technique that breaks down complex problems while maintaining awareness of the broader context.

### Implementation example
I need to solve the following complex problem: [describe problem]

Please help me by:

- Identifying the core components of this problem (minimum 3, maximum 5)
- For each component:
    a. Explain why it's important to the overall problem
    b. Identify what information or approach is needed to address it
    c. Solve that specific component
- After addressing each component separately, synthesize these partial solutions, explicitly addressing how they interact
- Provide a holistic solution that maintains awareness of all the components and their relationships

Throughout this process, maintain a "thinking journal" that explains your reasoning at each step.


This approach has been revolutionary for solving complex programming challenges, business strategy questions, and intricate analytical problems. The explicit tracking of relationships between components prevents the "tunnel vision" that often occurs with simpler decomposition approaches.

## 3. Controlled Hallucination for Ideation (CHI)

This technique might be controversial, but it's incredibly powerful when used responsibly. We all know LLMs can hallucinate (generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect content). Instead of always fighting against this tendency, we can strategically harness it for creative ideation.

### Example implementation

I'm working on [specific creative project/problem]. I need fresh, innovative ideas that might not exist yet.

Please engage in what I call "controlled hallucination" by:

- Generating 5-7 speculative innovations or approaches that COULD exist in this domain but may not currently exist
- For each one:
    a. Provide a detailed description
    b. Explain the theoretical principles that would make it work
    c. Identify what would be needed to actually implement it
- Clearly label each as "speculative" so I don't confuse them with existing solutions
- After presenting these ideas, critically analyze which ones might be most feasible to develop based on current technology and knowledge

The goal is to use your pattern-recognition capabilities to identify novel approaches at the edge of possibility.


I've used this for product innovation, research direction brainstorming, and creative problem-solving with remarkable results. The key is the explicit labeling and post-generation feasibility analysis to separate truly innovative ideas from purely fantastical ones.

## 4. Multi-Perspective Simulation (MPS)

This technique leverages the model's ability to simulate different viewpoints, creating a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of complex issues.

### Implementation

I need a thorough analysis of [topic/issue/question].

Please create a multi-perspective simulation by:

- Identifying 4-5 distinct, sophisticated perspectives on this issue (avoid simplified pro/con dichotomies)
- For each perspective:
    a. Articulate its core assumptions and values
    b. Present its strongest arguments and evidence
    c. Identify its potential blind spots or weaknesses
- Simulate a constructive dialogue between these perspectives, highlighting points of agreement, productive disagreement, and potential synthesis
- Conclude with an integrated analysis that acknowledges the complexity revealed through this multi-perspective approach

Throughout this process, maintain intellectual charity to all perspectives while still engaging critically with each.


This approach has been invaluable for policy analysis, ethical discussions, and complex decision-making where multiple valid viewpoints exist. It helps overcome the tendency toward simplistic or one-sided analyses.

## 5. Calibrated Confidence Prompting (CCP)

One of the most subtle but important advances in my prompt engineering practice has been incorporating explicit confidence calibration into prompts.

### Example
I need information about [specific topic]. When responding, please:

- For each claim or statement you make, assign an explicit confidence level using this scale:
    - Virtually Certain (>95% confidence): Reserved for basic facts or principles with overwhelming evidence
    - Highly Confident (80-95%): Strong evidence supports this, but some nuance or exceptions may exist
    - Moderately Confident (60-80%): Good reasons to believe this, but significant uncertainty remains
    - Speculative (40-60%): Reasonable conjecture based on available information, but highly uncertain
    - Unknown/Cannot Determine: Insufficient information to make a judgment
- For any "Virtually Certain" or "Highly Confident" claims, briefly mention the basis for this confidence
- For "Moderately Confident" or "Speculative" claims, mention what additional information would help increase confidence
- Prioritize accurate confidence calibration over making definitive statements

This will help me appropriately weight your information in my decision-making.


This technique has dramatically improved the practical utility of AI-generated content for research, due diligence, and technical problem-solving by preventing the overconfident presentation of uncertain information.
